The traditional method to share photos is to capture them on different phones, then take the time to upload the photos to some central repository, like iCloud, Google Photos, or Dropbox, and then sharing the photos with others. Or, you post it on social media, but the photo is then available to everyone in your network.

PictureUs solves this problem by creating a virtual camera for every group you have. Our app allows you to create a group of people, and then anytime you click the group, a camera is launched within the app. Anytime you take a photo with this camera active, the photos are instantaneously uploaded to our cloud and shared with the other members of the group.

Planned Future Features:
* Face recognition to identify who is in pictures and use this information to notify users when a photo of them has been shared.
* Video sharing
* Filters

**App is PERMANENTLY off the market as of July 2017 due to lack in demand.**

Traditional photo sharing is on the decline while services such as Snapchat gain popularity. Also, Snapchat created groups, which models the functionality of my app except the photos are temporary. But remember, you can also take screenshots in Snapchat, which could remove the use of my app, unless people want all of their photos to be high resolution.

Feedback from friends and family about why the app did not succeed include the fact that there are many other services offering similar functionality with more features.
